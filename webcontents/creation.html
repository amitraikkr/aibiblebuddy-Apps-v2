            <h1>The Story of Creation</h1>
            <p>In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth. The earth was formless and empty, and darkness was over the surface of the deep. Then God said, "Let there be light," and there was light. God saw that the light was good, and He separated the light from the darkness. God called the light "day" and the darkness "night." And there was evening, and there was morning—the first day.</p>
        
            <p>On the second day, God said, "Let there be a vault between the waters to separate water from water." So God made the vault and separated the water under the vault from the water above it. God called the vault "sky." And there was evening, and there was morning—the second day.</p>
            
            <p>On the third day, God said, "Let the water under the sky be gathered to one place, and let dry ground appear." And it was so. God called the dry ground "land," and the gathered waters He called "seas." Then God said, "Let the land produce vegetation: seed-bearing plants and trees on the land that bear fruit with seed in it." And it was so. The land produced vegetation, and God saw that it was good. And there was evening, and there was morning—the third day.</p>
            
            <p>On the fourth day, God said, "Let there be lights in the vault of the sky to separate the day from the night, and let them serve as signs to mark sacred times, and days and years." God made two great lights—the greater light to govern the day and the lesser light to govern the night. He also made the stars. God set them in the vault of the sky to give light on the earth, to govern the day and the night, and to separate light from darkness. And God saw that it was good. And there was evening, and there was morning—the fourth day.</p>
            
            <p>On the fifth day, God said, "Let the water teem with living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the vault of the sky." So God created the great creatures of the sea and every living thing with which the water teems and that moves about in it, according to their kinds, and every winged bird according to its kind. And God saw that it was good. God blessed them and said, "Be fruitful and increase in number and fill the water in the seas, and let the birds increase on the earth." And there was evening, and there was morning—the fifth day.</p>
            
            <p>On the sixth day, God said, "Let the land produce living creatures according to their kinds: the livestock, the creatures that move along the ground, and the wild animals, each according to its kind." And it was so. Then God said, "Let us make mankind in our image, in our likeness, so that they may rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky, over the livestock and all the wild animals, and over all the creatures that move along the ground." So God created mankind in His own image, in the image of God He created them; male and female He created them. God blessed them and said to them, "Be fruitful and increase in number; fill the earth and subdue it. Rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky and over every living creature that moves on the ground." And there was evening, and there was morning—the sixth day.</p>
            
            <p>On the seventh day, God had finished the work He had been doing; so on the seventh day, He rested from all His work. God blessed the seventh day and made it holy, because on it He rested from all the work of creating that He had done.</p>
            
            <p>This story teaches us the wonder of creation and the importance of rest.</p>
